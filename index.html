    <p> Greetings students and parents! As our class has sadly come to an end, I'd like to revisit concepts we've learned during the past 7 weeks. This is intended as a resource for students to use in their journey into web development. Above, I've included the sites created by the students.
    </p>

    <h2>What we've learned</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Typography &amp; Design basics</li>
      <li> Photoshop basics for creating Wireframes</li>
      <li> Creating a Website with GitHub Pages for free hosting</li>
      <li> HTML for creating the structure of their website</li>
      <li> CSS for styling their website</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="btn">
      <li><a href="setup.html">Setting up at Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="html.html">HTML</a></li>
      <li><a href="css.html">CSS</a></li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>Software</h2>
    <p>The tools used in the class are all available online for free.</p>
     <p><h3>Brackets [<a href="http://brackets.io">http://brackets.io</a>] </h3>
       Using a text editor specific to coding is not required but very helpful as it can do things like highlight your code so your eyes can follow your code or autocomplete elements.
       Brackets is our text editor of choice for the course as it allows a quick and easy option to view changes to your code with its live preview tool and
       color picker for choosing color without needing to know the code value for a color.
     </p>
     <p><h3>GitHub Desktop [<a href="https://desktop.github.com">https://desktop.github.com</a>] </h3>
       Git is version control system used for keeping track of changes in a directory. The records, amongst other data including the files themselves, are kept in what's called a repository.
       GitHub is a service that provides an online host for repositories. Finally, GitHub Desktop is the desktop application we use to interact with GitHub services and logging changes. Lessons in Git and GitHub are
       outside the scope of the course and aren't required for web development, but using these technologies, we found that it was the best way for the students not to loose their work, not rely on
       remembering to bring a flashdrive, and most importantly, host their website for free. Students were given the basic skills with GitHub to get their site up and running.
